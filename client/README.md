# vmi01 Frontend

This is a minimal React + Vite frontend to interact with the backend API in the workspace.

Usage:

- Install dependencies: `npm install` (run in `vmi01/client`)
- Start dev server: `npm run dev`
- The dev server proxies `/api` requests to `http://localhost:2811`

Notes:
- The backend must be running on port `2811`.
- The sample UI provides a list and simple create form for `Company`.
